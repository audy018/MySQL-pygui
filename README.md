# MySQL-pygui
A very basic shell for MySQL/MariaDB made using [MySQL Connector/Python](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/) and Tkinter. This project is purely for me to learn about interfacing with MySQL/MariaDB, and should not be seen as a replacement to any other tools.

## How to use
```
pip install mysql-connector-python
```
Also make sure to Tkinter installed if you're on Linux:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
Now you can simply extract the code and run the ```main.py``` file.
